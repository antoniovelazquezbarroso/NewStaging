# REPLICATION =====================================================
# YOU NEED UNCOMMENT THIS (SET THE mysql_replication_user)
# IF YOU WANT TO USE REPLICATION
mysql_replication_user: {name: 'replication', password: 'secret'}

# You will aldo need to define the following variables
# if you want to use replication
#
#    'mysql_replication_role'(master or slave),and
#    'mysql_server_id'(1 o 2) get defined in the inventory file.
#     You can also define them with .yml files named after each host
#     in the hosts_vars folder placed alongside the inventory file
#
#    'mysql_replication_master' is defined in the main.yml playbook,
#     as a pre-task, by dinamically setting a fact 
#     (the inventory data : hostnames, groups, IPs, etc)
#     once the playbook has started and after having run
#     the provision.yml playbook, that provides dynamic inventory data
#     for provisioning hosts from AWS or Digital Ocean
# =================================================================

# DATABASES TO CREATE (AND SETUP FOR REPLICATION) =================
mysql_databases:
  - name: railsapp_production
    collation: utf8_general_ci
    encoding: utf8
# You need to define databases here (before running the role)
# If you want them included for replication
# See the mysql role README
